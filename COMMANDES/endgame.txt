Congratulation, you defeated Volibear the thunder god ! But after that, the mountain starts 
to shake...
An earthquake is coming !! 
Unfortunately, you fall down and knock your head on a rock and looses your consciousness.
After you wake up, you are still in the Final Room, but Volibear is back again ! 

Volibear : Congratulation you proved me that you were still a fighter in your soul, i 
have to tell you the truth ... In fact, i never stole the rain ! haha, how did you 
thought that i could do that ! I used my power and challenged you in this mountain 
because in my houe where i live in thoundra i was completely bored and so i decided
to create this game just to have some fun, hope you enjoyed your trip. i'll reward
you of a treasure. You can tell your village they will have a good season of rain for
the next 5 years. i had a lot of fun watching you in the mountain.

Good bye !
