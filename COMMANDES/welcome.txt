Welcome to my adventure game !
You are living in lyrkeia since you were a kid
and one day...
A god named Volibear took the rain in his hand and locked it in a jar.
He then left a message telling to the old man that YOU must challenge the mountain
and free the rain or your entire village will no longer have rain. For ever.
